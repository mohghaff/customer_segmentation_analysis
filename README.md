Customer Segmentation Project Documentation
Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The primary objective is to identify distinct customer groups based on their behavior, specifically their income and spending levels. By leveraging exploratory data analysis and various clustering techniques, we aim to provide actionable insights into customer segmentation.

Data Source
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle, a well-known platform for data science competitions and datasets. The dataset includes various features relevant to customer demographics and behavior, such as age, annual income, spending score, and gender.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Tools Used
Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
EDA Process
Data Cleaning: Initial inspection of the dataset to handle any missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies.
Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation were calculated to understand the distribution of data.
Data Visualization: Various plots, including histograms, scatter plots, and box plots, were created to visualize data distributions and relationships between variables.
Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
Univariate Analysis: Focused on understanding the distribution of individual features such as Annual Income and Spending Score. This helped identify patterns and outliers within each feature.

Bivariate Analysis: Examined relationships between two variables at a time, such as the correlation between Annual Income and Spending Score. This provided insights into how different features interact with one another.

Behavioral Clustering
The core of this project revolves around clustering customers based on behavioral attributes, specifically Annual Income and Spending Score. The aim is to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their spending habits and economic capability.

Methods Used
Elbow Method: Utilized to determine the optimal number of clusters by analyzing the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS). The "elbow" point in the WCSS plot indicates where adding more clusters yields diminishing returns.

Silhouette Method: Used to validate the optimal number of clusters by measuring how well-separated the clusters are. A higher silhouette score indicates better-defined clusters.

Clustering Techniques
Three types of clustering analyses were conducted:

Univariate Clustering:

Focused solely on Annual Income.
Identified broad income groups, providing a basic segmentation based on economic capability.
Bivariate Clustering:

Analyzed Annual Income and Spending Score.
Offered a deeper understanding of customer behavior by considering both income and spending levels simultaneously.
Multivariate Clustering:

Included additional features such as Age and Gender alongside Annual Income and Spending Score.
Provided a more comprehensive segmentation by considering multiple factors influencing customer behavior.
Implementation
K-Means Clustering: The primary algorithm used for clustering due to its efficiency and scalability. It partitions data into k clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.
Results
Clusters Identified: Customers were segmented into different groups based on their behavior. The number of clusters for each analysis was determined by the Elbow and Silhouette methods, providing insights into distinct customer segments.

Cluster Characteristics: Each cluster represents a group of customers with similar spending habits and income levels, allowing businesses to tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

Conclusion
The customer segmentation project successfully identified distinct customer groups using behavioral clustering techniques. By applying EDA and various clustering analyses, we gained valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. These insights can be leveraged for targeted marketing, personalized offers, and improved customer engagement.
